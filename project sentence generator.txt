;Part IV : I wasn't sure how Yoda would speak using verbs in present tense ( "She talkS.", "The cat takeS." ), so I didn't really change the sentence structure just for Yoda-speak. I added "Yessssss." and "Hmmmmmm. Yes." and it has a 1/6 ( 16.66% ) of showing up. It works weirdly sometimes :(
; I also made a Valley Girl thing by adding "like , " (which has a space before the comma which I can't fix) before the verbPhrase. They talk like the stereotypical "white girl."
